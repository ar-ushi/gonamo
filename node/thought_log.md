Dumping my thoughts here while I build

Currently, I have the items as an array of item in my node.

At scale, if I have 1M items in my Data [], how do I give O(1) retrieval to keep latency high?
How do I make data persist? 
Define Position to help Node identify its bounds for a request
Do I need Peers?
